# A todo-lists app for you to start setting your life in order

You download the app from here and simply do the following steps:
`npm install` to install all the required packages
`npm run dev` to start up

If the tailwind doen't download correctly follow the steps here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

Important: you need to have you own firebase set up since I'm not going to give you my keys.
Simply create a firebase project and firestore db and firebase authentication in there. Then you can add the keys to your .env file like so
`VITE_FIREBASE_APIKEY=your-apikey`

If you want to chekout the app without creating a firestore, there is a netlify demo.
You can play around in this demo here:
